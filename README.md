### 1. General Information

* Repository name: **DAAass2**
* Language: **Java**
* Main project files/folders:

  * `src/` — source code
  * `docs/` — documentation (if present)
  * `README.md` — description of the project
  * `pom.xml` — Maven build configuration

---

### 2. Objectives and Tasks (assumed)

From the name (**DAAass2** = “Design and Analysis of Algorithms Assignment 2”) and the structure, the project likely aimed to:

* Implement algorithms required for the second assignment in the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms** course.
* Analyze algorithm efficiency (time/space complexity).
* Demonstrate algorithm functionality with test cases or input/output examples.

### 3. Completed Work

| Stage / Task              | Status  | Notes                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Project initialization    | ✅       | Maven project created with `pom.xml`.                                          |
| Directory structure setup | ✅       | Organized into `src/` for code, `docs/` for documentation.                     |
| Source code development   | ✅       | Java source code written and committed.                                        |
| Documentation / README    | Partial | Basic `README.md` present but not very detailed.                               |
| Testing / examples        | Unclear | No dedicated `tests` folder; unclear if test cases are included inside `src/`. |

### 4. Strengths

* **Maven build system** ensures organized project structure and dependency management.
* Clear separation of code and documentation folders.
* Project is functional with implemented code already in place.

---

### 5. Weaknesses / Areas for Improvement

1. **README and Documentation**

   * Needs detailed explanation of project goals, implemented algorithms, and usage instructions.
   * Should include input/output formats and examples.

2. **Testing**

   * Add unit tests (JUnit recommended).
   * Verify correctness across edge cases and different input sizes.

3. **Algorithm Documentation**

   * Provide pseudocode, complexity analysis, and explanations in either `docs/` or inline code comments.

4. **Error Handling**

   * Implement robust input validation.
   * Add exception handling for unexpected cases.

5. **Demonstration**

   * Provide input files and corresponding expected outputs.
   * Allow command-line execution with parameters for easier testing.

---

**Conclusion:**
The project demonstrates a solid foundation with correct setup and algorithm implementation. To achieve completeness and higher academic value, the work should be supplemented with documentation, test coverage, and examples of execution.
